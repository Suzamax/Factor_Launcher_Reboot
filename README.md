# Factor Launcher

Factor Launcher is an upcoming Android Launcher inspired by the original Windows Phone 7 design, supporting Android 6.0 to 11 

Dropped support for 5.0 due to [this issue](https://github.com/Valkriaine/Factor_Launcher_Reboot/issues/44).

(App shortcuts are not supported on devices running Android 7.0 and below since shortcuts were introduced in Android 7.1)

# Newest Version: 0.4.8-alpha

Finished the app settings screen, including the options to change tile colours

Added haptic feedback to buttons and sliders in the settings screen

Swipe down from the home screen to open notification panel

***currently the notification panel will not open if the home screen cannot be overscrolled (eg. having too few tiles)
